        <p>
          I have over 6 years of experience in software development. I have a
          strong knowledge of various programming languages and technologies.
          Most of my expertise is in the front-end development of JavaScript
          applications using React and Redux, issue detection, and resolving.
          Besides that, I got the AWS Solutions Architect â€“ Associate
          certification and polished my cloud knowledge by working as a
          full-stack developer for a few years on the last high- loaded project.
          I was implementing the Domain Driven Design architecture. I have a
          strong understanding of object-oriented concepts, design patterns, and
          different SDLC processes. I was involved in several long-term
          projects, which gave me strong experience in various software design
          and development areas. I am keen on functional programming concepts
          and mathematics and had a chance to practice that on a real project on
          Typescript. I am always open to new challenges with interest and
          enthusiasm. I am an open-minded and goal-oriented person. I have an
          active teamwork attitude and quick learning ability. I like the
          concept of how life imitates chess. I polish problem-solving on
          LeetCode along with data structures and algorithms understanding.
